# React custom hooks

## What is a react hook?
React Hooks are functions that let us hook into the React state and lifecycle features from function components.

## Why use them?
From the [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html): "We strongly recommend against creating your own base component classes. In React components, code reuse is primarily achieved through composition rather than inheritance."
